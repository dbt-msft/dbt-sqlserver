# Changelog

### v1.3.2

#### Features
- Allow setting table `OPTIONS` using `config`

#### Fixes

* Install a correct version of `dbt-core` that is compatible with the library 


### v1.3.0

#### Features

* Support for [dbt-core 1.3](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/releases/tag/v1.3.0)
  * Python models are currently not supported in this adapter
  * The following cross-db macros are not supported in this adapter: `bool_or`, `array_construct`, `array_concat`, `array_append`

#### Fixes

* The macro `type_boolean` now returns the correct data type (`bit`)

#### Chores

* Update adapter testing framework
* Update dependencies and pre-commit hooks

### v1.2.0

#### Possibly breaking change: connection encryption

For compatibility with MS ODBC Driver 18, the settings `Encrypt` and `TrustServerCertificate` are now always added to the connection string.
These are configured with the keys `encrypt` and `trust_cert` in your profile.
In previous versions, these settings were only added if they were set to `True`.

The new version of the MS ODBC Driver sets `Encrypt` to `True` by default.
The adapter is following this change and also defaults to `True` for `Encrypt`.

The default value for `TrustServerConnection` remains `False` as it would be a security risk otherwise.

This means that connections made with this version of the adapter will now have `Encrypt=Yes` and `TrustServerCertificate=No` set if you are using the default settings.
You should change the settings `encrypt` or `trust_cert` to accommodate for your use case.


#### Features

* Support for [dbt-core 1.2](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/releases/tag/v1.2.0)
  * Full support for the new [grants config](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/grants)
  * New configuration option: `auto_provision_aad_principals` - setting this to `true` will automatically create contained database users linked to Azure AD principals or groups if they don't exist yet when they're being used in grant configs
* Support for MS ODBC Driver 18
* Support automatic retries with new `retries` setting introduced in core
* The correct owner of a table/view is now visible in generated documentation (and in catalog.json)
* A lot of features of dbt-utils & T-SQL utils are now available out-of-the-box in dbt-core and this adapter. A new release of T-SQL utils will follow.
  *  Support for all `type_*` macros
  *  Support for all [cross-database macros](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/cross-database-macros), except:
    *  `bool_or`
    *  `listagg` will only work in SQL Server 2017 or newer or the cloud versions. The `limit_num` option is unsupported. `DISTINCT` cannot be used in the measure.

#### Fixes

* In some cases the `TIMESTAMP` would be used as data type instead of `DATETIMEOFFSET`, fixed that

#### Chores

* Update adapter testing framework to 1.2.1
* Update pre-commit, tox, pytest and pre-commit hooks
* Type hinting in connection class
* Automated testing with SQL Server 2017, 2019 and 2022

- fixes issue with changing column types in incremental table column type [#152](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/issue/152) [#169](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/pull/169)
- workaround for Azure CLI token expires after one hour. Now we get new tokens for every transaction. [#156](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/issue/156) [#158](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/pull/158)

### v0.20.1

#### fixes:

- workaround for Azure CLI token expires after one hour. Now we get new tokens for every transaction. [#156](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/issue/156) [#158](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/pull/158)

### v0.20.0

#### features:

- dbt-sqlserver will now work with dbt `v0.20.0`. Please see dbt's [upgrading to `v0.20.0` docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/migration-guide/upgrading-to-0-20-0) for more info.
- users can now declare a custom `max_batch_size` in the project configuration to set the batch size used by the seed file loader. [#127](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/issues/127) and [#151](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/pull/151) thanks [@jacobm001](https://github.com/jacobm001)

#### under the hood

- `sqlserver__load_csv_rows` now has a safety provided by `calc_batch_size()` to ensure the insert statements won't exceed SQL Server's 2100 parameter limit. [#127](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/issues/127) and [#151](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/pull/151) thanks [@jacobm001](https://github.com/jacobm001)

### v0.19.2

#### fixes

- fixing and issue with empty seed table that dbt-redshift already addressed with [fishtown-analytics/dbt#2255](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2255) [#147](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/pull/147)
- drop unneeded debugging code that only was run when "Active Directory integrated" was given as the auth method [#149](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/pull/149)
- hotfix for regression introduced by [#126](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/issues/126) that wouldn't surface syntax errors from the SQL engine [#140](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/issues/140) thanks [@jeroen-mostert](https://github.com/jeroen-mostert)!

#### under the hood:

- ensure that macros are not recreated for incremental models [#116](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/issues/116) thanks [@infused-kim](https://github.com/infused-kim)
- authentication now is case-insensitive and accepts both `CLI` and `cli` as options. [#100](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/issues/100) thanks (@JCZuurmond)[https://github.com/JCZuurmond]
- add unit tests for azure-identity related token fetching

### v0.19.1

#### features:

- users can now delcare a model's database to be other than the one specified in the profile. This will only work for on-premise SQL Server and Azure SQL Managed Instance. [#126](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/issues/126) thanks [@semcha](https://github.com/semcha)!

#### under the hood

- abandon four-part version names (`v0.19.0.2`) in favor of three-part version names because it isn't [SemVer](https://semver.org/) and it causes problems with the `~=` pip operator used dbt-synapse, a pacakge that depends on dbt-sqlserver
- allow CI to work with the lower-cost serverless Azure SQL [#132](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/pull/132)

### v0.19.0.2

#### fixes
- solved a bug in snapshots introduced in v0.19.0. Fixes: [#108](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/issues/108), [#117](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/issues/117). 

### v0.19.0.1

#### fixes
- we now use the correct connection string parameter so MSFT can montior dbt adoption in their telemetry. [#98](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/pull/98)

#### under the hood
- dbt-sqlserver's incremental materialization is now 100% aligneed logically to dbt's global_project behavior! this makes maintaining `dbt-sqlserver` easier by decreasing code footprint. [#102](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/pull/102)
- clean up CI config and corresponding Docker image [#122](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/pull/122)

### v0.19.0

#### New Features:
- dbt-sqlserver's snapshotting now 100% aligneed logically to dbt's snapshotting behavior! Users can now snapshot 'hard-deleted' record as mentioned in the [dbt v0.19.0 release notes](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/releases/tag/v0.19.0). An added benefit is that it makes maintaining `dbt-sqlserver` by decreasing code footprint. [#81](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/pull/81)  [fishtown-analytics/dbt#3003](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/3003)
#### Fixes:
- small snapshot bug addressed via [#81](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/pull/81)
- support for clustered columnstore index creation pre SQL Server 2016. [#88](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/pull/88) thanks [@alangsbo](https://github.com/alangsbo)
- support for scenarios where the target db's collation is different than the server's [#87](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/pull/87) [@alangsbo](https://github.com/alangsbo)

#### Under the hood:
- This adapter has separate CI tests to ensure all the connection methods are working as they should [#75](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/pull/75)
- This adapter has a CI job for running unit tests [#103](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/pull/103)
- Update the tox setup [#105](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver/pull/105)

### v0.18.1
#### New Features:
Adds support for:
- SQL Server down to version 2012 
- authentication via:
    - Azure CLI (see #71, thanks @JCZuurmond !), and
    - MSFT ODBC Active Directory options (#53 #55 #58 thanks to @NandanHegde15 and @alieus) 
- using a named instance (#51 thanks @alangsbo)
- Adds support down to SQL Server 2012
- The adapter is now automatically tested with Fishtowns official adapter-tests to increase stability when making 
changes and upgrades to the adapter.

#### Fixes:
- Fix for lack of precision in the snapshot check strategy. Previously when executing two check snapshots the same
second, there was inconsistent data as a result. This was mostly noted when running the automatic adapter tests. 
NOTE: This fix will create a new snapshot version in the target table
on first run after upgrade.

### v0.18.0.1
#### New Features:
- Adds support for Azure Active Directory as authentication provider

#### Fixes:
- Fix for lack of precision in the snapshot check strategy. (#74 and #56 thanks @qed) Previously when executing two check snapshots the same second, there was inconsistent data as a result. This was mostly noted when running the automatic adapter tests. 
NOTE: This fix will create a new snapshot version in the target table
on first run after upgrade.
- #52 Fix deprecation warning (Thanks @jnoynaert)

#### Testing
- The adapter is now automatically tested with Fishtowns official adapter-tests to increase stability when making changes and upgrades to the adapter. (#62 #64 #69 #74)
- We are also now testing specific target configs to make the devs more confident that everything is in working order (#75)
