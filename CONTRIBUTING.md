# Development of the adapter

Python 3.10 is used for developing the adapter. To get started, bootstrap your environment as follows:

Create a virtual environment, [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is used in the example:

```shell
pyenv install 3.10.7
pyenv virtualenv 3.10.7 dbt-sqlserver
pyenv activate dbt-sqlserver
```

Install the development dependencies and pre-commit and get information about possible make commands:

```shell
make dev
make help
```

[Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) helps us to maintain a consistent style and code quality across the entire project.
After running `make dev`, pre-commit will automatically validate your commits and fix any formatting issues whenever possible.

## Devcontainer

A devcontainer file has been added since 1.7.2 to simpify creating the development environment.

## Testing

The functional tests require a running SQL Server instance. You can easily spin up a local instance with the following command:

```shell
make server
```

This will use Docker Compose to spin up a local instance of SQL Server. Docker Compose is now bundled with Docker, so make sure to [install the latest version of Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Next, tell our tests how they should connect to the local instance by creating a file called `test.env` in the root of the project.
You can use the provided `test.env.sample` as a base and if you started the server with `make server`, then this matches the instance running on your local machine.

```shell
cp test.env.sample test.env
```

You can tweak the contents of this file to test against a different database.

Note that we need 3 users to be able to run tests related to the grants.
The 3 users are defined by the following environment variables containing their usernames.

* `DBT_TEST_USER_1`
* `DBT_TEST_USER_2`
* `DBT_TEST_USER_3`

You can use the following commands to run the unit and the functional tests respectively:

```shell
make unit
make functional
```

## CI/CD

We use Docker images that have all the things we need to test the adapter in the CI/CD workflows.
The Dockerfile is located in the *devops* directory and pushed to GitHub Packages to this repo.
There is one tag per supported Python version.

All CI/CD pipelines are using GitHub Actions. The following pipelines are available:

* `publish-docker`: publishes the image we use in all other pipelines.
* `unit-tests`: runs the unit tests for each supported Python version.
* `integration-tests-azure`: runs the integration tests for Azure SQL Server.
* `integration-tests-sqlserver`: runs the integration tests for SQL Server.
* `release-version`: publishes the adapter to PyPI.

There is an additional [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.ci/) pipeline that validates the code style.

### Azure integration tests

The following environment variables are available:

* `DBT_AZURESQL_SERVER`: full hostname of the server hosting the Azure SQL database
* `DBT_AZURESQL_DB`: name of the Azure SQL database
* `DBT_AZURESQL_UID`: username of the SQL admin on the server hosting the Azure SQL database
* `DBT_AZURESQL_PWD`: password of the SQL admin on the server hosting the Azure SQL database
* `DBT_AZURE_TENANT`: Azure tenant ID
* `DBT_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`: Azure subscription ID
* `DBT_AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME`: Azure resource group name
* `DBT_AZURE_SP_NAME`: Client/application ID of the service principal used to connect to Azure AD
* `DBT_AZURE_SP_SECRET`: Password of the service principal used to connect to Azure AD

## Releasing a new version

Make sure the version number is bumped in `__version__.py`. Then, create a git tag named `v<version>` and push it to GitHub.
A GitHub Actions workflow will be triggered to build the package and push it to PyPI. 

If you're releasing support for a new version of `dbt-core`, also bump the `dbt_version` in `setup.py`.
